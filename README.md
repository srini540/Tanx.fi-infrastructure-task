- I have created a dataset for the orders in the format of a CSV file naming it as "orders.csv" and then inserted the same into the google colaboratory files page and then tried to get the code for the same dataset.
- The code first reads the data inserted using the pandas library and then the computation of the dataset takes place.

The python code reads data from a CSV file containing customer orders and performs the following tasks:

- Computes total revenue generated by each month.
- Computes total revenue generated by each product.
- Computes total revenue generated by each customer.
- Identifies the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

# How to run #

3. All the requirements are downloaded from the requirements.txt file and the docker image is built.
4. Once the docker image is built we can run the docker image using the following command 'docker run "your_image_name"'.
5. Once it runs the output is showed on the command prompt.
